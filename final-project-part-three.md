# The final data story
[Link to Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/e-cigarettes-destroying-teens/index.html)



# Changes made since Part II
There were a few changes I made when I put the visualization and the story into shorthand. I added three more visualizations into the story, because these visualiations would further guide and explain the core of my story. The first one includes the data related to the revenue of the E-cigarettes, which could cleary present the trends of E-cigarettes in the recent year. The second one I added is the trends of high school students using E-cigarettes within recent years. The last visualization that I added is the statistics related to the percentage of flavor of the E-cigarettes that the teenagers tend to choose. I changed the color of the pie chart "the proportion of high school student who smoke", which makes color of the whole story more consistent. Finally, I makes the Call to Action section more detailed, providing with more specific methods. Different from part II, I insert multiple photos related to smoke and vape in this part.
