# The final data story
[Link to Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/e-cigarettes-destroying-teens/index.html)



# Changes made since Part II
There were a few changes I made when I put the visualization and the story into shorthand. I added three more visualizations into the story, because these visualiations would further guide and explain the core of my story. The first one includes the data related to the revenue of the E-cigarettes, which could cleary present the trends of E-cigarettes in the recent year. The second one I added is the trends of high school students using E-cigarettes within recent years. The last visualization that I added is the statistics related to the percentage of flavor of the E-cigarettes that the teenagers tend to choose. I changed the color of the pie chart "the proportion of high school student who smoke", which makes color of the whole story more consistent. Finally, I makes the Call to Action section more detailed, providing with more specific methods. Different from part II, I insert multiple photos related to smoke and vape in this part.

## The audience
My final audience would be the policy maker, parents/school, and teenagers (high school and middle school students). Policy maker could realize the urgency to protect our next generation, parents and school could get to know the proper way to educate their children, and teenagers would start awaring the harm of the E-cigarettes and help their friends who currently smoke to quit. In the call to action section, I list the achievable action that they could do for anti E-cigarettes. Based on the advice I get from the interview, I make the call to action for each group more specific.


# Final thoughts
At the very beginning of this project, I am struggling with the story I could tell from the data, so I only focus on the very general aspect of smoking. After I got the feedback and really think about which aspect I should narrow down to, I realize that I could use my own experience of smoking to write the story, like how I begin to smoke. Then, I start researching on E-cigarettes. I enjoy doing this project. If I have more time to dig into this topic, I really want to find some data about how E-cigarettes would affect human body to further strengthen my statement -- a more thorough analysis.
