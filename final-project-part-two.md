# Wireframes / storyboards
Personally, I am a smoker. When I think about what is the very first type of cigarette I smoke, the e-cigarettes comes to my mind. It tastes like candy and looks cool when you smoke with my friends. After that, I start to have the curiosity to try the cigarettes, and eventually get addictive to nicotine. In the project part I, I provide a very broad topics in the smoking, telling some very general points that people might already know, so I decide to narrow down my topic. As my experience, vaping is the start point of becoming a smoker. How about other people? With this question in my mind, I start to research on the related data. Below is the dataset that I used:

At the very start of my story, I provide the general trends of smoking in the United States. It shows that the consumption of normal cigarettes is actually decrease drmatically within these 10 years.

In the second visualization, I narrows the story to the youth level, presenting the proportion of smoker within students.

After that, I separate the whole smoking group of youth into different group by the category of the tobacco products, and found that the e-cigarettes is the most prevalent.

How is the e-cigarettes trends within this year? When it starts to become popular? With these two questions, I found the data related to the usage of e-cigarettes within middle school student.

I utilize the data from the survey to create this visualization, showing that people generally have the thought that e-cigarettes is not as harmful as the normal cigarettes.

I also found some numerical statistics to supoort my idea -- Youth like the taste of the e-cigarettes.
