# Wireframes / storyboards
Personally, I am a smoker. When I think about what is the very first type of cigarette I smoke, the e-cigarettes comes to my mind. It tastes like candy and looks cool when you smoke with my friends. After that, I start to have the curiosity to try the cigarettes, and eventually get addictive to nicotine. In the project part I, I provide a very broad topics in the smoking, telling some very general points that people might already know, so I decide to narrow down my topic. As my experience, vaping is the start point of becoming a smoker. How about other people? With this question in my mind, I start to research on the related data.
