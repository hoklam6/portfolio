# Outline
## Project Name: Unveiling the Smoke Screen

The ‘Unveiling the Smoke Screen’ project is a thorough examination of the trends, the distinction of the population and the health consequences of tobacco use”. This project is significant in combating one of the most widespread public health threats in the world today – tobacco smoking and its health impacts. There are effective campaigns about the dangers of smoking, but this causation of diseases and premature death is still the leading cause of many factors.

The essence of this project is to adequately describe smoking characteristics in a variety of social spheres, and to test existing anti-smoking strategies. Thus, the implementation of the project will help progress public health in all its aspects. Finally, decrease the prevalence of smoking and therefore reduce the health consequences associated with smoking.

In order to meet these aims, the project intends to use three datasets. The Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS), which ranges from 1999 to 2017, has more detailed information about tobacco use, tobacco cessation attempts, and tobacco advertising exposure among middle and high schoolers. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in the years 2011 to 2019 offered data on adult smoking behaviors. It covers smoking and electronic cigarette use, incidence and frequency as well. Finally, the 2015 NSDUH – National Survey of Drug users and health supply a broader perspective on drug use, including tobacco, and collects detailed information on the demographic correlates of substance use and health outcomes.

## Project Structure
### Setup
In this setup phase, we also establish the analytical frameworks and tools that will be used to dissect and display the data. Utilizing both statistical analysis and dynamic data visualization tools like Tableau, the project sets the stage for a deep dive into the patterns that these datasets reveal.

In the initial phase of the "Unveiling the Smoke Screen" project, my focus is on establishing a connection with the audience by setting the context and defining the goals. This setup is crucial for engaging and motivating the audience to take an interest in the study's findings on smoking behaviors.

I will provide a brief overview of the smoking landscape, including historical trends, current statistics, and the impacts of smoking. This background helps explain the audience to the issue's significance. Then, I will clearly state the project's purpose to align audience expectations with the study’s goals, which include illustrating tobacco use trends, identifying influencing factors, and proposing actionable recommendations.

### Conflict
The conflict in “Unveiling the Smoke Screen” arises from the critical public health challenges posed by smoking. I will identify the discrepancies in smoking behaviors across different demographics and regions. Key questions addressed include:
•	Why do certain demographic groups exhibit higher smoking rates?
•	What factors contribute to the effectiveness or failure of current smoking cessation and prevention efforts?
•	How do perceptions of smoking risks vary across different groups, and how do these perceptions affect smoking behavior?

This conflict phase is important as it highlights the gaps in current public health strategies and the challenges faced in reducing smoking prevalence and its health impacts. It also sets the stage for addressing these issues through targeted interventions.

### Resolution
The resolution phase of the project is dedicated towards coming up with and making recommendations of all the strategies that will help solve the established problems. Given the results established through the analysis of information collected, public health officials and decision makers can go on to develop more focused recommendations to help address a certain issue. A combination of these recommendations would encompass:

I will be concentrating on addressing the issues we've identified in the previous phases of research on the data that we've gathered and analyzed.

First, there should be the use of improved education campaigns. It is very important to create informative materials with an emphasis on the specific groups that are most vulnerable. Overall, addressing such issues, targeting the message will definitely help to achieve some positive outcome where it is needed.

Next, I advocate for policy reforms. We need stricter regulations on tobacco sales and marketing, with a keen focus on preventing youth access to these products. It's about making it harder for young people to start smoking in the first place, which can dramatically reduce smoking rates in the long term.

Next, I support such transformations in policies. We ought to introduce more control on the promotion and distribution of tobacco products, especially targeting the youth. Its about preventing the chances of youngsters getting introduced into the smoking ways that are most likely to bring down the rates of smoking in the future generations.

And finally, I endorse the community-based approaches. There is great importance of supporting tobacco quit programs initiated by communities. Such programs are more likely to work because they are more culturally relevant and contextually effective. They can harness local resources and engage active local people creating a strong barrier force for change.

# The data
1. Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) Data (1999-2017)
The YTS data provides necessary information on how smoking is acquired and developed among the youth. This database sheds light upon the rate of smoking, the pro-tobacco advertising exposure and the school-based tobacco interventions.

2. Behavioral Risk  Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Data (2011-2019)
The BRFSS dataset offers a comprehensive look at adult smoking behaviors, cessation efforts, and the use of emerging tobacco products like e-cigarettes. This dataset is crucial for understanding adult smoking patterns and their implications on health.

3. National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015)
NSDUH provides broader context on substance use, including tobacco. This dataset includes detailed demographic information that helps in understanding the social and economic factors influencing tobacco use.

# Method and medium
Descriptive Statistics: The foundation of our analysis involves descriptive statistics, which will provide basic summaries about the samples, such as measures of tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and proportions. This approach will help in understanding the distribution and central characteristics of the data without making assumptions or inferences about the population that the data are drawn from.

Comparative Analysis: Using basic comparative statistical techniques, we will identify significant differences in smoking rates and behaviors across different demographics and over time. This will involve comparing percentages, calculating rate changes, and identifying trends within the datasets.

Visualization and Dissemination Tools

Tableau: For the purpose of very dramatic and interactive graphics efforts especially Tableau will be engaged. This tool provides the option to create dashboards that translate complex sets of data clearly to the audience, assisting them in comprehending the trends, patterns and outliers within the data. Line graphs will be used to show trends and bar graphs used for demographics and heat map for the standing of smoking rates in relation to the locations or areas occupied. 

Shorthand: For the purpose of considering the audience's information the project results will be redacted into attention grabbing narrative in a format of a visual storytelling using Shorthand. This medium will allow us to incorporate text, Tableau visualizations, and other multimedia elements seamlessly, providing an immersive experience for the reader. The Shorthand story will follow a structured narrative, guiding the audience through the data insights, their implications, and recommended interventions.
